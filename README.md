(fnuc) ->
=========

> cause i want it my way.

fnuc is a library for [functional programming][funcp] in coffeescript
(and javascript). The reason for providing the "standard" javascript
methods as pure functions is to facilitate
[functional composition][compo] and [higher order functions][highf].

### Installing with NPM

```bash
npm install -S fnuc
```

Inject into global

```coffee
require('fnuc').expose(global)
```

Enable chainables (modifies `Function.prototype`)

```coffee
require('./src/fnuc').expose(global).installChainable()
```

Or use it library style with a prefix:

```coffee
F = require `fnuc`  # all functions under F
```

### Installing with Bower

```bash
bower install -S fnuc
```

### Compatibility

Tested on IE9+, Chrome 38+, Firefox 34+, Safari 7+.

About
-----

Design philosophy:

1. fnuc tries to follow the
   [principle of least astonishment][princ]. This shows in function
   argument order which is clearly spelled out in this
   [stack overflow answer][stack].
2. Less is more. fnuc provides the most used basics, not every
   conceivable utility function. Please
   [suggest](https://github.com/algesten/fnuc/issues) functions to add
   if anything important is missing.
3. I don't mind OOP. fnuc focuses on functions that are somewhat
   interesting for [function composition][compo], not a functional
   purist approach where everything must be functions.


### Argument order

We expect a function such as `div` to have the following two forms:

```coffee
div(a, b)    # a divided by b
div(b)(a)    # right section (`div` b)
```

`div` is [curried][curry] and `div10 = div(10)` can only have the meaning
*division by 10*. Hence `div10 20` should equal `2`.

Other least astonished variants that are *not in fnuc*:

```coffee
div(_, b)    # left section (a `div`)
a `div` b    # infix haskell style
a.div b      # infix coffeescript style
```

### Chainable sequencing

To install builtins on `Function.prototype` do:

```coffee
require('./src/fnuc').installChainable()
```

Most functions in fnuc are [chainable](api.md#chainable). This means
as an alternative to [`sequence`](api.md#sequence) and
[`compose`](api.md#compose), we can simply chain them together.

```coffee
f = add(10).div(4).mul(5.6)
f(20)                         # 42
```

This is equivalent to

```coffee
f = sequence add(10), div(4), mul(5.6)
```

In words: For a number, add 10 to it, divide the result by 4 and
finally multiply the *that* result with 5.6

```coffee
((x + 10) / 4) * 5.6
```

#### Arity `any -> 1 -> 1 -> 1`

The first function can take *any* number of arguments, so can the
sequenced result. However subsequent functions operate on the result
of the previous, which can only be *1*. This means there's a risk of
slipping up by not providing enough parameters when chaining.

```coffee
f = add(10).mul      # Warning! mul needs 2 arguments.
```

This chain produces a function, but I struggle to find any sane use
for it.

As a rule of thumb, try to ensure each function in a chain only
expects one more argument.

```coffee
f = split('').join('_').replace(/a/g,'b')
f('aaacc')                                  # 'b_b_b_c_c'
```

#### Making your own chainable

The API provides an easy way to define your own
[chainable](api.md#chainable) function: `chainable(name,f)`.

```coffee
even = (n) -> n % 2 == 0
chainable 'even', even

f = mul(3).even
f(10)            # true
f(11)            # false
```
